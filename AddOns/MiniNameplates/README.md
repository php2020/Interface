### Reminder:  
If this is the first time installing the addon and want to customize some lua options
1. rename _settings.lua to settings.lua (remove the leading underscore _ )
2. edit whatever values you want to change in settings.lua

##Changelog:
- Fix Level text and Boss texture overlapping.
- Add an option for click-through toggling in _settings.lua (genSettings section).
- Fix a missing comma in _settings.lua causing the addon to not load for fresh installs
- Add emphasize functionality for target nameplate.
- Add an optional texture replacement package that prevents border / glow flickering  
when spam clicking a target or at low refresh rates.
- [Work in Progress] Start on an options GUI and Per character saved variables.

##Downloads:
Since [1.5-alpha](https://github.com/Dridzt/CustomNameplates/releases/) and later package also contains an **optional** texture replacement package in CustomNameplates-Interface.zip  
If you install it, this CustomNameplates-Interface.zip needs to be extracted 
directly inside **\<wow_install\>\Interface\**   
**not** inside **\<wow_install\>\Interface\AddOns\** like the main addon.
