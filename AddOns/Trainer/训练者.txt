== v1.01 - 25th April 2018
* Farseer Umbrua added. TBC Stormwind Shaman Trainer. Not a Broken or Lost One in sight! Sigh
* Farseer Javad added. TBC Ironforge Shaman Trainer
* Champion Cyssa Dawnrose added. Proudly bringing Paladin light to the city of the undead. Sigh
* Master Pyreanor added. Rounds out the dubious trainers. This one for Paladins in... Orgrimmar. Shudder.
