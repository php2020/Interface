This Mod was created to have a better visibility when you gain buffs or débuffs. Very util for shorts buffs or débuffs, it allows you to have in the center of the screen, or around your character, very customizable visual effects, rather than all the time have to look on the other side of the screen to see if you have a buff or a debuff on you.

Initially created to have an better visibility on the short buffs like "clear cast" or some boost trinket you activate, it works now with debuffs (whatever their name) and also debuff types like Magic or Curse.

How to use :

Type /powa
to open the effect editor, then you can choose the texture to apply to the effect, the position, the size, the symmetry, etc...
Then, enter the name or a part of the name of the buff / débuff (ex: if you try to activate the visual effect on "Clear cast", you can enter only "Clear" in the name of the buff).

The Mod will take care to show the effect where you wish and to remove it when the buff is finished.


You can so easily change the 20 available textures or add new ones.


Texture Pack :
--------------

Unzip this file like you do with the Mod, you will now have some more textures on the Power Auras directory. Just run the game, type /powa and go to Advanced Options to put the parameter "Max number of textures" to the last installed texture file (if you have installed the "TexturePack21-30", you have now a maximum of 30 textures).
