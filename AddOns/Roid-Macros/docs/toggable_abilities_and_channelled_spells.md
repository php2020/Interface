# Toggleable abilities and channelled spells

This AddOn allows you to ensure that channelled spells aren't cast again until
they're finished or interrupted. In addition, this also works for auto
attacking, shooting wands or shooting ranged weapons. This can be done by
putting an exclamation mark at the beginning of the spells name.

## Examples

```lua
/cast !Mind Flay
```

You may now spam that button and Mind Flay will only be re-cast when the last
one has finished or gets interrupted.

---

```lua
/cast !Attack
```

```lua
/cast !Shoot
```

```lua
/cast !Auto Shot
```

Again, using this macro will ensure that your Attack ability is active without deactivating it.
